# Customer-Churn-Prediction

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for customer churn in a subscription-based service or business. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription or cease doing business with a company. By predicting churn, businesses can proactively identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies to reduce customer attrition.

The project utilizes historical customer data, including various features such as usage behavior, customer demographics, and subscription details. Three different machine learning algorithms are explored for building predictive models: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

**Files Included**

1. *Churn_Modelling.csv* : Sample dataset containing historical customer data, including features and churn status.

2. *Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_MLtechiques.ipynb* : Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and comparison of different algorithms.

3. *README.md* : This README file providing an overview of the project, instructions, and details.

**Setup Instructions**

To run the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the required Python libraries.
4. Open and run the Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_MLtechiques.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Dependencies**

The project requires the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

**Results**

The project evaluates the performance of three different machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn: *Logistic Regression*, *Random Forests*, and *Gradient Boosting*. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is identified based on these metrics, and insights into feature importance are also provided.

**Conclusion**

By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and profitability. This project serves as a demonstration of building and comparing predictive models for customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques.
